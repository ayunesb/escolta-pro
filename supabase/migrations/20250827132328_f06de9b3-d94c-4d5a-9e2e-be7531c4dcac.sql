-- 1) Ensure RLS is enabled

-- 2) Remove overly permissive INSERT policy if it exists

-- 3) Explicitly deny INSERTs for anon/authenticated (service role bypasses RLS)
CREATE POLICY "assignments_insert_denied"

WITH CHECK (false);

-- 4) Keep existing guard SELECT policy if present; otherwise (idempotent re-create)
